## Crowd Funding Analysis Report

### Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

#### Form Pivot Table, Parent Category

- It seems like that most of the campaigns successful are related to arts.

- So, the bars depict the high volume of success in theater with 199, film & video 102, and third music with 99.

- The data shows that journalism have all the least volume of projects with successful status.

- Rest of the fours categories including technology have average ratio with slight positive numbers for successful projects as compare to the failed ones.

#### From Pivot Table, Sub-Category

- “Plays” has the prominent most high values from all the other categories for number of projects and the successful rate. Crowdfunding is 7 to 8 times larger than all others projects.

- The “rock” and “documentary” cross above 50 numbers for crowdfund with good successful projects.

- As rest of the categories are under 50 and doesn’t explicit any significant differences between them.

#### From Pivot Table, Date Conversion

- It seems that there are a lot of people who are putting out campaign in the summer months that’s why there are number of successful attempts goes up in the summer months.

- It also seems like failed and cancelled campaign do not get effected by the month of the year.

#### From Outcome Based Goals

- We do have an increase for successful attempts ranges from 15k to 35k. 

- Most people do not bother funding for expensive projects more than 50k.

- Cancel attempts are consistent across the goal buckets.




### What are some limitations of this dataset?

- I have no breakdown for backers counts for goals and pledges. So. There are no individual details to know more individuals people contribution to the projects.

-  We have funds but with different currencies. A standardize format is required for making more accurate comparisons regarding the currency with respect to projects.


### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

#### Two Pie Charts

- Pie chart can create to analyze the number of projects and fundings with respect to countries.

- Another pie chart can be created to determine that how many pledge amounts are available for projects.

- Helps which country have the highest amount of funds.

#### Two Scattered Charts

- We can plot scattered chart for X axis as goals and   y-axis as pledge to know trends for funds for goals and pledges.

- Another scattered chart can be possible to know for country with currency wise.

- If as the pledge amount is higher than the goal for projects.

- Above scattered charts could use for visualizing the successful and failed projects.








## Statistical Analysis

#### Determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.

- According to summarized information, we can estimate that mean is higher than the median.

- We can see there are a lot of outliers in the box plots and there is right-skew distribution, then median would be the best measure to explain the data.

- Mean is pulled by the outliers, i.e., biased for distribution the data.

#### Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

- The deviations are right-skewed.
- More variability is having more backers count in the successful campaigns rather than unsuccessful campaigns.
- The distribution for successful campaigns according to standard deviation.













    • Our distribution is right-skewed, because we have more outliers.
